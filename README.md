## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
**Description:**
Analysis of the World Population per country and city.<br>
Data clean-up:
1.	Merging data from various datasets
2.	Check for duplication
3.	Check for invalid value
4.	Made sure the data frame is consistent for all the data set.
5.	Made sure no rows accidentally deleted


**Summary:**
The current US Census Bureau world population estimate in June 2019 shows that the current global population is 7,577,130,400 people on earth, which far exceeds the world population of 7.2 billion from 2015. Our dataset estimate which is based on UN data shows the world's population surpassing 7.7 billion.

Many other nations have populations of at least one million, while there are also countries that have just thousands. The smallest population in the world can be found in Vatican City, where only 801 people reside.

Although the number presented in our project seems very precise, it is important to remember that it is just an estimate. It simply isn't possible to be sure exactly how many people there are on Earth at any one time.

**Questions to Answer:** <br>
1.	From the Coffee's quality factors can we predict the Coffee bean Species, Processing Method used and Altitude, Country or Region of Origin?
2.	Which Species of Coffee is produced more?
3.	Which all are the major Coffee Producing countries?
4.	Which Countries are the major importers of Coffee?
5.  Is Coffee Beans or Roast and Ground or Soluble(Instant) Coffee Exported more by the Countries producing Coffee?
